'''
Purpose: As the label range of our model is from 1 to 50,
the label range provided by the official chaos_train/test_1fps.csv is 0-49.
Here, make a match and create chaos_train/test_1fps_t_+1csv.

Input: chaos_train_1fps_woXGXJVBCQ.csv or chaos_test_1fps.csv

Output: chaos_train_t_+1.csv or chaos_test_t_+1.csv
